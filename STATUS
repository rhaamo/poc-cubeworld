This project is currently frozed/abandonned.

I've started with http://dave.uesp.net/wiki/Block_Land but a lot of code is missing ...

I'm missing the whole world terrain generation (what the fuck is infland or CMap ???)
  -> Layers and differents block types depends on world terrain gen
    -> caves depends on layers
      -> Better lightning depends on caves to see the result
    -> Water depends on layers

So, finally because i can't guess what all this code is/are/do i froze and stop this projet.

You need the OgreSDK and OIS framework, also install libnoise with the CVS version !

Pkg-config stuff are required for libnoise !

After build you need to run "../do_ugly_osx_bundle.sh" FROM THE 'build' directory !

This will copy resources.cfg and plugins.cfg and also copy stuff to the bundle to ... hum ... works

This is very ugly but i'm very lazy to fix it for the moment ... eh, that's not a pre-alpha! ;)
